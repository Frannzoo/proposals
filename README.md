Official repository for House of Stake proposals

Note: We recommend posting and discussing proposals on the [NEAR Governance Forum](https://gov.near.org/), but final proposals should be added here before being voted on. This repository serves as the single source of truth for HoS Proposals.

Note: All proposals posted in this repository, as well as the contents of metadata including issues and pull requests, are released into the public domain under the terms of the [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license](LICENSE).
